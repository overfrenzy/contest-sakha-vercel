## B. Orchestra
**Time limit:** 1 second **Memory limit:** 256 MiB

The conductor of a symphony orchestra once fell ill. Without the conductor, the musicians found it difficult to play in the common rhythm. To achieve this, some musicians look at one of their colleagues and try to play in sync with them. Other musicians just close their eyes and play by ear.

If you trace who is looking at whom, you can construct chains of musicians where each musician looks at the next person. Sometimes these chains end up in a loop. Let’s assume that a musician cannot appear twice in the same chain.

Unfortunately, our orchestra has not rehearsed much so far and often starts to play out of sync. This happens because there are separate groups of musicians who only look at each other and don’t look at musicians from other groups.

To learn how to play better, the musicians ask you to write a computer program to analyze the current situation.

#### Input
The first line of the input data contains *N* — the number of musicians in the orchestra (*N* < 4 ⋅ 104).

Each of the following *N* lines contains one colleague’s number who the current musician is looking at. If the number 0 appears, then the current musician doesn’t look at anyone.

#### Output
In the first line, your program must output the number of independent groups of musicians *K*.

In the next *K* lines, your program must output the number of musicians in the maximal-length chain in each group of musicians. These numbers must appear in ascending order.

#### Note
The points for each test are awarded independently.

## C. Find and prevent
**Time limit:** 5 seconds **Memory limit:** 256 MiB

The Ministry of Transportation of Treeland found out about a forthcoming illegal protest action in one of the cities of Treeland. Members of a group that calls itself "Biconnected" are threatening to organize a traffic nightmare by blocking ways in and out of one of the cities to draw attention to drawbacks of the current road network. It is known that their goal is to cause maximum damage to transport connectivity of the whole country.

There are *N* cities in Treeland and, as you may have guessed, the road network can be represented as a tree graph. Population of *i*th city

 is *a<sub>i</sub>* people. If there are several cities that rebels can choose, then they are going to target the one with the smallest number.

The Ministry was recently a victim of severe budget cuts, therefore there is no one able to find out the target city of the activists, so they are asking for your help.

Transport connectivity of the country is equal to the number of pairs of people that can reach each other by roads or are living in the same city.

#### Input
The first line contains a single integer *N* (1 ≤ *N* ≤ 1000000).

The second line contains *N* numbers *a<sub>1</sub>*, *a<sub>2</sub>*, … , *a<sub>N</sub>* (1 ≤ *a<sub>i</sub>* ≤ 100).

Each of the following *N* − 1 lines describing the road system of Treeland contains 2 integers - pair of cities that are connected by a road.

#### Output
In the first line, output the number of the city in which the action will take place.

In the second line, print the new value of transport connectivity in the case that the action succeeds.

#### Note
This problem has three subtasks. Points for each are awarded only if the solution passes all the tests from this subtask.

## D. Expected xor
Time limit: 1 second Memory limit: 256 MiB

There’s a legend about a holy tree in Romania, with a number *M* written around its roots. Under the tree, an old man with a giant book is sitting from time immemorial, rolling *N* distinct magical dice. Each dice has *A<sub>i* sides (*A<sub>i* and *M* are coprime, i.e. the greatest common divisor of *A<sub>i* and *M* is 1) numbered from 0 to *A<sub>i - 1*. When the dice are rolled, the old man takes the numbers on each dice *b<sub>i* and records the value of *b<sub>1* * b<sub>2 *XOR* ...  *XOR* *b<sub>N* in his book, where *XOR* is bitwise exclusive OR. According to the legend, the combinations of the magical dice never repeat, and when they are exhausted, the world will end. Compute the arithmetic mean of the numbers in the old man’s book at the world’s end modulo *M*, as described below.

#### Input
The first line contains positive integers *M*, *N* (*N* ≤ *50000*, *2* ≤ *M* ≤ *10^9* + *7*). The second line contains *N* positive integers *A<sub>i* (*A<sub>i* ≤ *262*, *i* = 1, ..., *N*).

#### Output
Print non-negative integer *X* (*X < M*) such that, if the answer is the fraction *U* (where *U* and *V* are integers), then the product of *X* and *V* has the same remainder as *U* when divided by *M*:

$X \cdot V \equiv U \ (\text{mod} \ M)$.

#### Note

In the second example, the answer is 274, so we print 8, because $8 \cdot 63 = 

504 \equiv 4 \equiv 274 \ (\text{mod} \ 10)$.

## E. Odd Taxi
Time limit: 2 seconds Memory limit: 256 MiB

You have the task to take all the participants of the Olympiad home. The city’s roads can be represented as a rooted tree on $n$ numbered vertices. The location of the Olympiad is in vertex number 1. Each vertex number $i > 1$ is connected by a road to the vertex $p_i$ ($p_i < i$). You have a contract with a company "Odd Taxi", which provides two types of cabs:

1. One-passenger, the fare is $dist_v \times x$ rubles, where $dist_v$ — the number of roads from the root 1 to destination $v$.
2. Two-passenger, the fare is $dist_v \times y$ rubles, and the cab driver takes one passenger to the destination vertex $v$ and can drop off the second passenger at any vertex on the way to $v$ including $v$.

The cab always takes the shortest path, and a two-passenger cab cannot take only one passenger.

If each vertex $i$ has $a_i$ participants living there, what is the minimum amount of money that should be spent to get everyone home?

#### Input
The first line contains the number of vertices $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 5000$), the fares of the first and second cab type, $x$ and $y$ respectively ($1 \leq x \leq 105$, $1 \leq y \leq \min(2x - 1, 105)$).

The second line contains $n - 1$ numbers $a_2, \ldots, a_n$ — the number of participants living in each vertex ($0 \leq a_i \leq 105$).

The third line contains $n - 1$ numbers $p_2, \ldots, p_n$ — parents of the vertices ($1 \leq p_i < i$).

#### Output
Output a single number — the amount of money required.

#### Note
This problem has three subtasks. Points for each subtask are awarded only if the solution passes all the tests of that subtask and all previous subtasks.

The tree from the second sample. It’s optimal to order a two-passenger cab for the participants from vertices 2 and 5, and a one-passenger cab for the participant from vertex 4. In total, we will pay $3 \times y + 2 \times x = 12$.

## F. Alien music
Time limit: 1 second Memory limit: 256 MiB

In the future, humanity has found a way to quickly travel across the galaxy. Alice is a young researcher from the 22nd century who studies the alien civilization of Rumatas.

In this civilization, there is an analogue of earthly music. Alice found out that alien music is composed of $N$ consecutive notes. Unlike earth music (which has only 7 different notes), an alien composer can choose from $M_i$ options (1 ≤ $i$ ≤ $N$) for the $i$-th note in the melody.

Also, it is important to know that each note has a tone, and the melody as a whole has an accent tone. It is required that the melody contains exactly 2 notes in an accent tone to be considered harmonious.

Write a program to calculate the amount of different melodies that comply with the rule of harmony of alien music.

#### Input
The first line of the input data contains a natural number $N$ ≤ 15 and an accent tone number $K$ (0 < $K$ ≤ 20).

The second line contains $N$ natural numbers $M_i$ ≤ 10 — the number of different notes in the melody.

The following $N$ lines contain $M_i$ numbers, which indicate the tonality of each note.

#### Output
Write down the number of different alien melodies that comply with the rule of harmony.

#### Note
The points for each test are awarded independently.

#### Examples

| Standard Input                              | Standard Output |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 3 1<br>4 5 2<br>1 2 3 4<br>1 2 3 3 4<br>1 2 | 8               |

#### Note
There will be 3 notes in the melody. The emphasis is on tonality #1.

For the first note, there are 4 options. For the second note, there are 5 different options (2 of them are of the same tone), and 2 options for the third note.

If the composer chooses the first and second notes for the accent tone, then there is only one option for the third note.

If the composer chooses the first and third notes for the accent tone, then there are 4 variants of the second note.

If the composer chooses the second and third notes for the accent tone, then there are 3 options for the first note.

Thus, in total, there are 8 different harmonic melodies.

## H. Earthquake
Time limit: 2 seconds Memory limit: 256 MiB

Another earthquake hit the city of Tubeville, and the residential water supply system stopped working.

Mario, the chief plumber of the city, still a youth then, designed Tubeville’s water supply system to be earthquake-resistant. To achieve it, he broke the city area into square blocks and made the pipe sections in each block easily detachable from each other and rotatable around the center of the block into one of four positions.

Sadly, this architecture has the following problem: when an earthquake occurs, all pipe sections detach from each other and randomly turn around their block’s center. To fix it, we need to return the pipe sections into position, preventing water from spilling, supplying all houses with water while preventing leaks. The design of the system precludes moving the pipes from one block to another.

#### Input
The first input line contains positive integers $N$ and $M$ describing the size of Tubeville (1 ≤ $N$, $M$ ≤ 10).

Each of the following $N$ lines contains $M$ numbers. Each number is a description of a city block $[i, j]$ (0 ≤ $i$ < $N$, 0 ≤ $j$ < $M$).

A house that needs water supply is denoted by the number 2222, and the area with a water source is denoted by the number 3333. Otherwise, the number consists of four ones or zeroes, each representing the presence or absence of a connection to the neighboring block, starting from the upper neighbor on the map in clockwise order.

#### Output
Your program must output $N$ lines of $M$ numbers matching the input data format. If there are several solutions, then output any of them. We guarantee the existence of the solution.

#### Note
The points for each test are awarded independently.

#### Examples

| Standard Input                                                           | Standard Output                                                   |

#### Note
Some pipe segments may be spare and not used in the water supply system. In that case, they must not be connected to a water source to prevent wa- ter leaks. Houses cannot occupy an block adjacent to a water source. Also, houses cannot pass water through to other houses.

## I. The maze of the RoboBear
Time limit: 2 seconds Memory limit: 256 MiB

Today Darina has received an email. It claims that the latest breakthrough of *Sakha Dynamics*, the RoboBear, has learned to pass mazes with the minimum number of turns along the way.

"Anyone who can go through this maze in fewer turns will receive a barrel of delicious coffee," the email says. Darina doubts if she needs so much coffee, but she asks you to help her calculate the minimum number of turns to pass the maze. Then, knowing the answer, she can decide whether she should try to beat the RoboBear.

#### Input
The first line contains two integers, $N$ and $M$ $(1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5, 1 \leq N \cdot M \leq 10^5)$.

Each of the following $N$ lines contains $M$ characters. Symbols `.` and `*` denote an empty square or a wall, respectively. The letter `E` denotes the exit from the maze. The starting point is marked by one of the letters: `U`, `D`, `L`, `R`, depending on the direction that the robot is facing initially (Up, Down, Left, or Right, respectively).

#### Output
Your program must write a positive integer number, the problem's answer, or $-1$ if RoboBear cannot reach the exit without breaking the walls.

#### Note
The points for each test are awarded independently.

## J. 1D Arkanoid
Time limit: 4 seconds Memory limit: 256 MiB

Sargylana is learning game development, her first project is Arkanoid in 1D. The game looks as follows: there is an infinite tape divided into square cells, some cells contain obstacles. You can put the ball into any cell without an obstacle and push it to the left or to the right. To simplify the problem, we consider the obstacles to be infinitely thin and the ball to be infinitely small. Every second the following happens:

- The ball moves to the next cell according to its current direction,
- If the cell contains an obstacle, then the ball changes its direction to the opposite, the next second it will begin moving in the reverse direction.

The obstacle it hit is destroyed, and the ball will be able to pass through it in the future.

To make sure there are no bugs in the game, Sargylana is going to the part of the game engine responsible for the ball's movement. She made some tests: given initial obstacle locations and many queries "if we put the ball in the cell $x_i$ and push it left or right, where would it be after $t_i$ seconds?". Note that all queries are independent: obstacles destroyed during a query will be present again for the next one.

#### Input
The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ $(1 \leq n \leq 10^6, 1 \leq m \leq 3 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of obstacles and the number of queries. The next line contains $n$ integers

 $x_1 < x_2 < \ldots < x_n$ ($|x_i| \leq 10^9$) — numbers of cells containing obstacles, in the increasing order. Next $m$ lines contain queries. Every line contains a character $L$ or $R$ and two integers $p_i$ and $t_i$ ($|p_i| \leq 10^9$; $0 \leq t_i \leq 10^{18}$). If the character is $L$, then the ball starts moving to the left; if it's $R$, then the ball starts moving to the right.

It's guaranteed that the cell $p_i$ does not contain an obstacle.

#### Output
For each query, print an integer — the position of the ball in the $i$-th query after $t_i$ seconds.

#### Note
This problem has five subtasks. Points for each subtask are awarded only if the solution passes all the tests of that subtask and all previous subtasks.

## Solutions
## A. Necklace
Several different methods may solve this problem with varying degrees of efficiency.

It is possible to represent a necklace as a binary number of 2n digits, where ones and zeros correspond to the beads of different colors. Unfortunately, solutions of this kind are usually ineffective. They can only pass the tests of the first subtask for 20 points.

Another group of solutions uses the method of mapping. These solutions introduce an additional array to store the difference between blue and red beads. Such solutions work more efficiently. They can pass tests of two subtasks and get 40 points.

The most effective are solutions that apply formulas for Catalan numbers. As a result, they will successfully pass all tests and achieve the maximum score.

Let's explain the solution using an explicit formula for the Catalan numbers. Denote by C(k) the number of variants for constructing a necklace with k beads. Consider first the case of an even number of beads k. Thus, k - 1 is odd and, by the conditions of the problem, the kth bead can be of any color. That is, in the case of even k, we have

C(k) = 2 * C(k - 1).

Now consider the case of odd k. Consequently, k - 1 is even, and we can add a blue bead to the existing k - 1 beads without breaking the rules.

However, if we add a red bead to the same k - 1 beads, some variants will be excessive. These variants appear when we add a red bead to the equal number of blue and red beads.

Let m = (k - 1)/2. It is known that if the number of red and blue beads is equal, and at the same time, the number of blue beads is always greater than or equal to red, then the number of variants for constructing a necklace is equal to the Catalan number C(m) (where (a) stands for binomial coefficient). Therefore, if k is odd:

C(k) = 2 * C(k - 1) - (m + 1) * C(m).

Naturally, C(1) = 1 and C(2) = 2. Now, using the above recurrent formulas, you can easily calculate the number of necklace variants.

## B. Orchestra
Let's build a directed graph where the musicians will correspond to the vertices.

After analyzing the conditions of the problem, it is easy to understand that there can't be more than one cycle in each connected component (for strict proof, try to construct a counterexample).

You can use a standard graph traversal algorithm (either breadth-first or depth-first search) to count the number of connectivity components. Notice, it is better to implement graph traversal in an iterative style since it will prevent stack overflow.

It is also easy to see that the graph often contains specific vertices that have no incoming arcs. Let's call them "tails" for definiteness. You can place such vertices into a separate list during the reading of input data.

Every chain is starting at one of such tails. To find the chain of maximal length, you can write a loop to check them. Inside it, you will need a WHILE-type loop to count the vertices of the chain.

![Chains](sB.png)

## C. Find and prevent
Let's select vertex root as the root of the tree (you can always choose vertex 1 as the root).

We need to count sums in all subtrees. That can be done with a simple depth-first search algorithm. Denote the sum in a subtree with root i as STS[i]. Now we can easily calculate the required value for any vertex — if we remove edges connected

 to vertex i, transport connectivity can be found by the formula:

(STS[root] - STS[i])(STS[root] - STS[i] - 1)
------------------------------------------------------ + ∑ STS[j](STS[j] - 1)
                         2

where j ∈ children[i].

The final algorithm complexity is O(N).

## D. Expected xor

The main ideas of the full solution are:

0. Mean xor can be computed by finding the probabilities for each of the 63 bits that they will be set to 1 and adding these probabilities weighted by 2k, where k is the bit index.
0. The probabilities can be computed independently of each other.
0. Once we fix the bit k (where k is from 0 up to 62) whose probability that it will be set to 1 in the xor sum we want to compute, we can loop through the array and update this probability as we encounter new numbers.
0. If the probability that the xor sum of the numbers in the array prefix considered so far contains bit k set to 1 is q, and the probability that the newly encountered number (by which we extend the aforementioned prefix) has 1 in bit k is p, the probability q' that the xor sum for the extended prefix is p(1 - q) + (1 - p)q.
0. Initially, when the considered prefix is null, q is 0. Finally, when the considered prefix is the whole array, q is the required probability. As per a previous observation, we just add q * 2k to the answer.
0. To compute the probability p that a certain number b that is randomly chosen from the set {0, 1, … , A - 1} has bit k set to 1 is a matter of O(1) calculation. Hints: (A >> (k + 1) << k); if (A&(1 << k)) consider (A&((1 << k) - 1)).

To work with modular probabilities, here it’s enough to think about division by A as multiplication by modular_inverse(A). Since A's are all co-prime with the modulo number M, these modular inverses exist for each A and can be computed in O(log M) time after precomputing the number of numbers less than M that are coprime with M.

## E. Odd Taxi

For each node, we want to determine how many participants will sit in a two-passenger cab with some of the descendants of the root of the subtree. To do this, let us calculate dp[v][cnt] — the cost of the subtree v if we add cnt participants (participants without pairs from ancestors) to the root of the subtree. Note that in the optimal answer cnt ≤ number of leaves in the subtree, otherwise, there’s a pair of participants in the subtree that lie on the same path from the root, it’s more profitable to put them in one cab. How do we compute this value?

We need to match cnt participants with the descendants, this is a backpack problem, where dp[u][cnt1] is an item with weight cnt1. This will add up to O(n^2). It remains to take into account the participants who were left without a pair at the root of the subtree. Suppose there are cnt left, you have to pay

depth[v] * ⌊ cnt ⌋ * y + depth[v] * (cnt % 2) * x

2

(integer division and modulo remainder). These values with the same parity form an arithmetic progression, so you can calculate the values dp[v][cnt] using dp[v][cnt1 < cnt] by maintaining two minima. The answer will be in dp[1][0].

## F. Alien music

After analyzing the condition of the problem, you can understand that the number of options can be large, so you should use the int64 (long long int) type variable to store it

.

When reading the input data, you need to create two linear arrays: let denote them a and b. In the array a, we will store the number of notes with an accent tone. And in the array b — the number of other notes.

First, we create a double loop to check all the two-note variations with an accent tone.

Then, for each selection of two notes with an accent tone, you need to count the number of options for all the remaining notes with other tones.

On this diagram two notes are selected (i = 2, j = 4). In this case, The number of options can be obtained by the formula:

b1 ⋅ a2 ⋅ b3 ⋅ a4 ⋅ b5 = 4 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 1 ⋅ 3 = 48.

### Pseudocode:
```cpp
long long int answer = 0;
for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
  for (int j=i+1; j<n; j++) {
    long long int count = 1;
    for (int k=0; k<n; k++) {
      if ((k != i) && (k != j)) {
        count *= b[k];
      }
    }
    answer += a[i] * a[j] * count;
  }
}
```

## G. A circuit board

Check whether L can be the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with integral legs.

In case it cannot, the wires may only be parallel to the sides of the board. A greedy solution obtained for one of the two possible orientations will be optimal. We fill the available space with horizontal wires arranged in columns, going from left to right while possible. If space remains after that, we fill it with vertical wires arranged in rows similarly. This should be tried for both possible orientations of the board. An example for L = 3 on a board of size 5 × 10 is shown.

To prove the maximality of this solution, color the nodes along the diagonals into L + 1 colors. Because the wires may only be vertical or horizontal, each wire takes up exactly L + 1 nodes of different colors. So the greedy algorithm leaves the nodes of the colors that have more nodes. In the picture above, they are colors 1 and 2.

If L is a hypotenuse in an integral-side right-angled triangle, we must additionally consider the “diagonal” direction of the wires. If the legs are coprime, each wire takes up only 2 nodes. Horizontal or vertical wires will take up more nodes. So if the wires run diagonally parallel to each other, their number is only a little less than half the number of nodes. An example for L = 5 on a board of size 6 × 8 is shown.

Nonparallel wires will “get in each other’s way”. Thus, it is almost obvious that we should try running the wires diagonally parallel

 to each other in each of the possible directions.

## H. Earthquake

To solve the problem, you should organize an iterate over all available options. To optimize performance, you can take advantage of some features:

1. The search does not include squares with values 0000, 1111, 2222, 3333.
2. Straight pipes can be aligned in the process of recursively checking the correctness of the pipeline.
3. Pipes cannot lead to 0000 and outside the city.

Thus, the enumeration involves cells with two and three ones, as well as pipes adjacent to the water source.

To check the correctness of the option, you should use a recursive bypass of the pipeline with the number of connected houses.

**Pseudocode:**
```
Initialize count = 0

for each option in possible options:
    if option is a valid pipeline:
        increment count

return count
```

## I. The maze of the RoboBear

To solve the problem, we need two basic things: dynamic programming and BFS.

The main idea of the problem is to calculate the minimum number of turns for each point individually, and then, knowing the first points we reach from them, we can reach other points.

Firstly, let us define a mechanism for visiting cells. When we arrive at some cell, we memorize two parameters for that cell: how many turns we needed to get there and whether we arrived there vertically or horizontally. If we visited that square both vertically and horizontally, we don't need to work on it later because all the squares on the left, right, top, and bottom sides have already been visited.

Then, mark the movement from each cell to the next. If we have visited a square horizontally, we go from here vertically; otherwise, we go horizontally. For each cell visited from point A, we put the number of turns to A plus 1.

The last point is the order of visiting squares. The next square to visit is the square that needs the minimum number of turns we have available. By going around this way, we ensure that we take the minimum number of turns to get to each square we visit because otherwise, we would have another starting square that we haven't yet reached, and that has a smaller path than the current one, which can't be the case.

So, having understood these main points, we can safely solve this problem. The problem's asymptotic is O(Nlog(N)) when prioritized via ordered_queue and O(N) when implemented carefully.

## J. 1D Arkanoid

We're going to answer each query independently. First of all, let's figure out how many obstacles the ball is going to destroy. We will use binary search: to use it, we need to be able to find out how many seconds the ball will need to destroy k obstacles.

Without loss of generality, we will consider a ball that is pushed to the right. That ball will destroy ⌈k⌉ obstacles to the right of its initial position and ⌊k⌋ obstacles to the left. The time required to do that can be calculated with a straightforward simulation.

To get 100 points, we can use prefix sums. Let the positions of left obstacles be x1, …, xm, and the positions of right obstacles be y1, …, ym. The sum of times when the ball moved from left to right is y1 - pi + y2 - x1 + ... + ym - xm-1. Rearranging this sum, we get y1 + y2 + ... + ym - (pi + x1 + ... + xm-1), which can be calculated with prefix sums. Similarly, we can calculate the time it takes to move the ball from right to left. Implement this part carefully to deal with all the parity cases.

Now, we can use binary search to calculate the time it takes to destroy these k obstacles, find the remaining time, and find the final position of the ball. This solution works in O(n + m log n) time complexity.
